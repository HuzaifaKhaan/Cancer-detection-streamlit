# 🩺 Chest Cancer Detection with Streamlit

Welcome to the **Chest Cancer Detection** project! This repository hosts a Streamlit web application designed to identify various types of lung cancer from chest X-ray images using a deep learning model.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Our application utilizes a pre-trained `InceptionV3` model to provide predictions on uploaded chest X-ray images. This tool aims to assist in the early detection of lung cancer, enhancing diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Prediction**: Upload an X-ray image and receive instant predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for seamless interaction.
- **Model Integration**: Uses advanced deep learning techniques for accurate results.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- Git Large File Storage (LFS)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amitkumar2308/Cancer-detection-streamlit.git
   cd Cancer-detection-streamlit

2. **Setup Virtual Environment**
     ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt


4. **For Uploading Large files** 
   ```bash
   Use Git LFS

5. **Run the application** 
    ```bash
    streamlit run model.py


🖼️ How It Works

1. **Upload an Image**

   Click on the "Choose an image..." button to select a chest X-ray image in .png, .jpg, or .jpeg format.

2. **Receive Predictions**

   Click "Predict" to analyze the image. The application will display the predicted type of lung cancer and provide confidence levels.
